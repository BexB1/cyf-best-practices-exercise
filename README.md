# HTML + CSS Best Practices exercise

In this exercise, you'll fix some poorly-written HTML and CSS according to best practices.

1. Begin by `forking` the repo at <a href="https://github.com/BexB1/cyf-best-practices-exercise">https://github.com/BexB1/cyf-best-practices-exercise</a>
2. From your forked version of the repo, copy the SSH and clone the repo onto your computer through the terminal with `git clone [your SSH here]`.

Tips:

1. First things first, the folder structure needs some tidying. `ada-lovelace.jpg`, `grace-hopper.jpg` and `katherine-johnson.jpg` should be in an `img` folder. You'll need to change your HTML `<img>` tags to point to their new location.
2. Does the `index.html` have everything it needs at the top?
3. All of the code need to be indented correctly.
4. Your CSS class names will need to be _semantic_.
5. Make sure there's no unnecessary white space in either your HTML or CSS.
6. Your images will need `alt` text for accessibility.
7. Lastly, don't forget your version control with Git! You should `commit` at least three times, and `push` to your forked repo.
